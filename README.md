# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

I'm trying the advent of code in Rust this year to learn Rust.

## Formatting and linting

Use:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

## Tests

Use:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Running

Download the input files to `input/<number>.txt`. For example, `input/01.txt`.

Use:

```bash
cargo run -r --bin 01
```

(`-r` for release mode highly recommended for `05` and `06`!)
